About This Repository
This repository showcases the projects and assignments I've completed during my internship at Hitasoft, where I gained hands-on experience in both frontend and backend development. My journey includes working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. Recently, I've delved deeply into PHP, finding it incredibly engaging and powerful for web development.
